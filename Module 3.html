    <h2> Introduction to  Electric components and Circuits and ESP 32.</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>I. Electric components</h3>
    <h4> Electric circuit definition.</h4>
    <p> An electric circuit is a  closed-loop or path, forming a network of electrical components where electrons can flow.</p>
    <p>This path is made using electrical wires and is powered by a source like a battery.</p>
    <p>Electric circuits form the backbone of all electronic systems.</p>
    <br>
    <h4> Components of Electric Circuits</h4>
    <p> The basic components of electric circuits include; 
        <ul class="centered-list"> 
        <li> A voltage source </li> 
        <li> A load </li>
         <li> A conductive pathway</li>
    </ul> </p>
        <p> A voltage source is an electrical component that supplies energy. It provides a potential difference for the charges to flow. Examples of voltage sources are a battery and a generator.</p>
        <p>The load in a circuit is a device that uses electrical energy. A load can be a resistor, a light bulb, or a motor.</p>
        <p>A conductive pathway provides a path for the current to flow and is used to connect the electrical components to each other and the power source.</p>

        <p>
            <ol>
            <li><b>Power Source </b>: Provides the initial electrical energy to power the circuit.</li>

           <li><b>Resistor</b>:resistors are used to reduce current flow, adjust signal levels and to divide voltages.</li>
            <li><b>Capacitor</b>: Stores and releases electrical energy to filter noise and stabilize voltage.</li>
            
            <li><b>Inductor</b>: Stores energy in a magnetic field and smooths current flow in switching circuits.</li>
            
            <li><b>Diode</b>: Allows current to flow in one direction and blocks reverse current to protect the circuit.</li>

            <li><b>LEDS(Red, Blue, Yellow)</b>: 3 mm LED Diodes Red Yellow Blue Green round LED Light Emitting Diode.</li>

            <li> <b> Push button</b> : Feature momentary contact, 4 pins, round black push button, through hole mounting, 6 x 6 x 5mm size</li>

            <li><b> Potentiometer(10k)</b> :acts as a voltage divider</li>

           <li><b>Bridge Rectifier</b>: Converts AC input to DC using four diodes in a bridge configuration.</li>
            
            <li><b>Transformer</b>: Changes AC voltage levels and provides electrical isolation.</li>
            
            <li><b>Fuse</b>: Protects the circuit by breaking the connection if current exceeds a safe level.</li>
            
            <li><b>Current Sensor / Shunt Resistor</b>: Measures current flow for monitoring and protection purposes.</li>
            
            <li><b>Power Switch</b>: Controls the on/off state of power delivery in a circuit.</li>
            </ol>
