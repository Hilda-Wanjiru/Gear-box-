    <h2>I. Introduction to Embedded systems</h2>
    <hr>
    <p> An embedded system is a combination of computer hardware and software designed for a specific function.</p>
    <br>
    <p> Embedded systems typically contain a microprocessor -- or a microcontroller-based system, memory and input/output devices </p>

    <h2>II. Introduction to IDE's</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>IDE definition: An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently.
         It increases developer productivity by combining capabilities such as software editing, building, testing, and packaging in an easy-to-use application.</p>
      <br>
    <h3> Types of IDE's</h3>
        <h4> 1. Thonny IDE</h4>
            <p> Thonny is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python that aims to make learning and teaching programming easier.
                 Developed by Aivar Annamaa at the University of Tartu, Thonny is designed to provide a beginner-friendly environment for writing and debugging Python code. 
                 It is open-source software and is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux platforms.</p>
         <h4> 2. Arduino IDE</h4>
            <p> Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is an open source IDE that allows users to write code and upload it to any Arduino board. 
                Arduino IDE is written in Java and is compatible with Windows, macOS and Linux operating systems.</p>

    <h2>III. Introduction to C and C++</h2>
    <hr>
            <h3> C definition</h3> 
                <p>C is a general-purpose programming language created by Dennis Ritchie at the Bell Laboratories in 1972.
                It is a very popular language, despite being old.
                 The main reason for its popularity is because it is a fundamental language in the field of computer science</p>

     <h4> Explanation of the code .</h4>
        <p> <b> Line 1</b>: #include <stdio.h> is a header file library that lets us work with input and output functions, such as printf() (used in line 5). 
            Header files add functionality to C programs.
            <br>
             <b>Line 2 and 4</b>: A blank line. C ignores white space. But we use it to make the code more readable.
                <br>
                <b>Line 3</b>: Another thing that always appear in a C program is main(). This is called a function. Any code inside its curly brackets {} will be executed.
                <br>
                <b> Line 5</b>: printf() is a function used to output/print text to the screen. In this  example, it will output "Hello World". 
                <br>
                <b>Line 6</b>: return 0 ends the main() function.
                <br>
                <b> Line 7</b>: The closing curly bracket } to actually end the main function.
                </p>
     <h3> C variables </h3>
     <img src="C Variables.png">
<p> Variables are containers for storing data values, like numbers and characters.
<br>
    In C, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords), for example:
        <br>
        a. <b>int</b> - stores integers (whole numbers), without decimals, such as 123 or -123
        <br>
        b.  <b>float</b>- stores floating point numbers, with decimals, such as 19.99 or -19.99
       <br>
             c.<b> char</b> - stores single characters, such as 'a' or 'B'. Characters are surrounded by single quotes
        </p>
